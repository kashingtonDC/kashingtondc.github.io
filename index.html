			<p>I turn data about the world into actionable information to help humans enjoy a harmonious living with nature. Scientist, researcher, friend, son, explorer, reader, builder of things, advocate, optimist, musician are a few adjectives that might describe me. Head to the <a href="/research">Research Page</a> to get an idea of what I've been up to. Feel free to contact me with ideas, questions, or just to say hey using the links below.</p>
